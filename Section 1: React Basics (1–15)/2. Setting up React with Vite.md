### Topic 2: Setting Up React with Vite

React can be set up in many ways, but using **Vite** offers a modern, fast, and lightweight experience for building React applications. Vite is a build tool developed by Evan You (creator of Vue) that drastically improves development speed with its instant hot module replacement (HMR), faster startup, and optimized builds.

#### Why Choose Vite Over Create React App?

Previously, most developers used `create-react-app` (CRA) to start React projects. However, CRA is slower, especially with large apps. Vite improves this with:

* Lightning-fast dev server
* Instant module hot updates
* Minimal configuration
* Smaller final bundle

So, for better performance and a cleaner setup, Vite is now the go-to choice.

#### Prerequisites

Before setting up React with Vite, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (or `yarn`) installed.

Check by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these commands return version numbers, you're ready to proceed.

#### Step 1: Create a New React + Vite App

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

This will:

* Create a folder called `my-react-app`
* Set up a basic Vite + React template

Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Project Structure Overview

Once installed, your project will have a clean and minimal structure:

```
my-react-app/
├── public/
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.css
│   └── main.jsx
├── index.html
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js
```

* `main.jsx` is the entry point.
* `App.jsx` contains your main component.
* `index.html` is where the React app mounts.

#### Step 3: Running the Development Server

Start the app using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You’ll see:

```
VITE vX.X.X  ready in X ms

Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

Open the URL in your browser, and you'll see the default React page powered by Vite.

#### Step 4: Editing the App

Open `src/App.jsx` and modify it:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React with Vite!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Once saved, Vite will instantly reflect the changes in the browser—no manual refresh needed.

#### Conclusion

Setting up React with Vite is fast and modern. It gives you a lightweight, production-ready setup with almost no configuration. As you continue building apps, you’ll appreciate Vite’s speed and flexibility compared to older tools like CRA.
