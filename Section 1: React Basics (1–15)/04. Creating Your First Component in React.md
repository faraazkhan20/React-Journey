### Topic 4: Creating Your First Component in React

React is all about **components**. Everything you build in React—from buttons to entire pages—is built using components. A **component** is a small, independent, and reusable piece of UI. Components make code easier to manage, test, and reuse across your application. This topic will walk you through creating your first component step-by-step, explaining what components are, how they work, and how to structure them properly.

#### Understanding React Components

In React, a component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX (a syntax that looks like HTML). Components can be as small as a single button or as large as an entire web page section. React components can be categorized into two types: **functional components** and **class components**. In modern React (especially with the introduction of Hooks), functional components are preferred due to their simplicity and power.

Here’s a simple example of a **functional component**:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Hello from the Welcome component!</h2>
      <p>This is your first React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is a plain JavaScript function returning a JSX block. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript, which React then compiles into actual HTML.

#### Setting Up the File Structure

Let’s say you’ve created a project using Vite, and your basic project folder has a `src` directory. Inside `src`, you’ll want to organize your components in a folder, typically named `components`. Create that folder first:

```
/src
  /components
    Welcome.jsx
  App.jsx
```

Create a file named `Welcome.jsx` inside the `components` folder. This will house your first custom component. Add the following code:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Hello from Welcome Component</h2>
      <p>You're now writing reusable UI using React!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Welcome;
```

The `export default Welcome;` line means that other files can import and use this component.

---

#### Using the Component in App.jsx

To display this new component in your app, open `App.jsx` (also in `src/`) and import `Welcome`. You can then use it just like a regular HTML tag:

```jsx
import Welcome from './components/Welcome';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Main App Component</h1>
      <Welcome />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This is how **component composition** works in React. You build small pieces like `Welcome` and nest them inside larger components like `App`.

---

#### Adding Basic Styling

Let’s add some CSS styling to the component. In the same `components` folder, create a file called `Welcome.css`:

```css
.welcome-container {
  background-color: #e8f0fe;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Now import and apply this CSS class in your `Welcome.jsx` file:

```jsx
import './Welcome.css';

function Welcome() {
  return (
    <div className="welcome-container">
      <h2>Hello from Welcome Component</h2>
      <p>You're now writing reusable UI using React!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Welcome;
```

Now your component will be styled with a light blue background, rounded corners, and centered text.

#### Naming Convention and Best Practices

* Use **PascalCase** for component file and function names (`Welcome.jsx`, not `welcome.jsx`).
* Keep each component in its **own file** for better structure.
* Use folders to group related components if needed.

---

#### Conclusion

You’ve now created your first functional component in React, styled it, and used it inside the main `App` component. This is a major first step in understanding React’s architecture. Components allow you to break down your UI into manageable, reusable pieces. From this point onward, you’ll keep building more components and combining them to create full-featured apps. Understanding how to create and use components effectively is the heart of mastering React development.
