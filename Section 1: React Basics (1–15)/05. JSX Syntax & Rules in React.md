### Topic 5: JSX Syntax & Rules in React

React uses **JSX** (JavaScript XML), a special syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript. JSX makes writing UI structures easy and intuitive by mimicking the structure of HTML, but with the full power of JavaScript behind it. Although it looks like HTML, JSX is not a string or HTML—it gets transpiled into `React.createElement()` calls behind the scenes.

---

#### JSX Is Not HTML

At first glance, JSX might look just like HTML, but it’s actually JavaScript. For example:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```

This line creates a React element that will render as an `h1` tag in the browser. JSX allows embedding this directly within JavaScript, giving you a more natural way to write UI components.

---

#### Return Only One Root Element

In JSX, a component must return **a single root element**. If you try to return multiple sibling elements without wrapping them, it will throw an error. To avoid this, wrap multiple elements in a `div`, or use React fragments.

**Incorrect:**

```jsx
function Example() {
  return (
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Description</p>
  );
}
```

**Correct:**

```jsx
function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Or using a **React Fragment**:

```jsx
function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

Fragments (`<> </>`) are useful when you don’t want to add an extra `div` to the DOM.

---

#### Use `className` Instead of `class`

Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than HTML, you can’t use `class` for CSS class names. Instead, you must use `className`.

**Incorrect:**

```jsx
<div class="box">Text</div>
```

**Correct:**

```jsx
<div className="box">Text</div>
```

This is because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.

---

#### Self-Closing Tags Are Required

In HTML, some elements like `<img>` and `<input>` are self-closing, and the browser is forgiving if you forget the slash. In JSX, you **must** explicitly self-close these tags.

**Incorrect:**

```jsx
<img src="logo.png">
```

**Correct:**

```jsx
<img src="logo.png" />
```

JSX requires all self-closing tags to be properly closed.

---

#### JavaScript Expressions Inside JSX

JSX allows you to write JavaScript expressions inside curly braces `{}`. This can be variables, function calls, or expressions.

```jsx
const user = 'John';

function Greeting() {
  return <h2>Hello, {user}!</h2>;
}
```

You can also use inline calculations or conditions:

```jsx
function AgeDisplay({ age }) {
  return <p>{age >= 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor'}</p>;
}
```

---

#### Attributes in JSX

JSX attributes are written in **camelCase**, unlike HTML. For example, `onclick` becomes `onClick`, `maxlength` becomes `maxLength`, and so on.

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
<input maxLength={10} />
```

Also, attribute values in JSX are passed as JavaScript expressions, so wrap them in `{}` unless you’re passing a plain string:

```jsx
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" width={200} />
```

---

#### Comments in JSX

To write comments inside JSX, use `{/* comment */}` instead of `//` or HTML-style comments.

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    {/* This is a JSX comment */}
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
  </div>
);
```

---

#### Wrapping Long JSX

When your JSX spans multiple lines, it’s best practice to wrap the return in parentheses for better readability:

```jsx
return (
  <div className="container">
    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
```

---

#### Conclusion

JSX is a powerful feature of React that makes writing user interfaces more intuitive by combining JavaScript and HTML-like syntax. While it may look like HTML, it comes with its own rules—such as using `className`, camelCase properties, returning a single root element, and self-closing tags. Understanding JSX deeply is essential for writing clean, maintainable, and error-free React components. Once you're comfortable with JSX syntax, you'll find it easier to structure components and inject dynamic content within your UI.
