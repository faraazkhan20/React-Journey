### Topic 7: Props and Passing Data in React

In React, **props** (short for “properties”) are the primary way to pass data from one component to another—usually from a parent component to a child. Props allow components to be **dynamic**, **reusable**, and **customizable** by giving them external input. Think of props as **arguments** that you send to a function, but here you're sending them to components.

#### Why Use Props?

Imagine creating a `Greeting` component that shows a different name for each user. Without props, you'd need to manually write separate components for each user, which is inefficient. With props, you can write one generic `Greeting` component and just supply it different data when needed.

---

#### Declaring and Using Props

Props are passed to a component as attributes in JSX and received as parameters in the function definition. Here's a basic example:

```jsx
// Greeting.jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

And you can use it like this in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
import Greeting from './components/Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Alice" />
      <Greeting name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

When React renders `<Greeting name="Alice" />`, it passes `{ name: "Alice" }` as the `props` object to the `Greeting` component. The same happens for "Bob".

---

#### Destructuring Props

Instead of accessing props using `props.name`, you can **destructure** the props directly in the function parameter:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

This is a cleaner and more modern approach and is preferred when you have multiple props.

---

#### Passing Multiple Props

You can pass as many props as you want. Let’s enhance our example with more details:

```jsx
function UserCard({ name, age, city }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <p>City: {city}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Usage in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
<UserCard name="Alice" age={25} city="New York" />
<UserCard name="Bob" age={30} city="London" />
```

Each instance of the `UserCard` component receives its own data through props, making the component flexible and reusable.

---

#### Props Are Read-Only

It’s important to understand that props are **immutable** inside the child component. You can **use** them, but you cannot **change** them. React enforces a unidirectional data flow, which means data flows **from parent to child** only.

Trying to modify props like this will result in errors or unexpected behavior:

```jsx
function Profile({ name }) {
  name = "Hacked"; // ❌ Don't do this!
  return <h1>{name}</h1>;
}
```

Instead, use state if you need to handle changing values within a component.

---

#### Passing Functions as Props

You can also pass **functions** as props, which is a common technique for communication from child to parent.

Example:

```jsx
function Button({ handleClick }) {
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

function App() {
  const showAlert = () => {
    alert("Button was clicked!");
  };

  return <Button handleClick={showAlert} />;
}
```

Here, the parent `App` component passes a function `showAlert` as a prop to `Button`. When the button is clicked, it calls the function defined in the parent.

---

#### Props with Default Values

Sometimes, you want to assign default values to props. You can do this using default parameters:

```jsx
function Welcome({ name = "Guest" }) {
  return <h2>Welcome, {name}!</h2>;
}
```

Now, even if no `name` is passed, it will default to "Guest".

---

#### Passing JSX as Props (Children)

You can pass JSX elements between a component's opening and closing tags using the special `children` prop:

```jsx
function Wrapper({ children }) {
  return <div className="wrapper">{children}</div>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <h1>Hello from inside the Wrapper!</h1>
    </Wrapper>
  );
}
```

The `Wrapper` component wraps any content placed inside it using `children`.

---

#### Conclusion

Props are a foundational part of React's component-based architecture. They allow you to make your components configurable and reusable by passing dynamic data and behavior. Whether you're passing simple strings, numbers, functions, or even JSX, mastering props is essential to building scalable and maintainable React applications.
