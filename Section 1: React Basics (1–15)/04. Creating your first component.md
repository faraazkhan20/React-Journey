### Topic 4: Creating Your First Component in React

In React, everything revolves around **components**. A component is a reusable, independent block of UI that can be nested inside other components. Think of it like a LEGO brick—you can combine multiple components to build a complete interface. Learning how to create your first component is a fundamental step in working with React effectively.

#### Understanding Components

There are two types of components in React: **functional** and **class-based**. In modern React development, functional components are the standard, especially when combined with React Hooks. A component is simply a JavaScript function that returns JSX (a syntax extension that looks like HTML).

Let’s start by creating a simple functional component called `Welcome`.

#### Creating the Component File

Inside your `src/` folder, create a new directory called `components`. Then create a file named `Welcome.jsx` inside it. Here's how the component looks:

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Welcome to React!</h2>
      <p>This is your first component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Welcome;
```

This function returns a block of JSX. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript. Notice how we're using `h2` and `p` tags just like in HTML. The `export default Welcome;` line allows this component to be used in other parts of the app.

#### Using the Component in App.jsx

Now, open your `App.jsx` file and import the `Welcome` component you just created:

```jsx
import Welcome from './components/Welcome';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Main App Component</h1>
      <Welcome />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the JSX returned by `App`, you can see we’re using `<Welcome />` just like a custom HTML tag. This is how components are reused in React. The `Welcome` component renders its content within the main `App` component.

#### Adding Some Styling

Let’s also add a simple CSS file to style your component. Create a file called `Welcome.css` in the same `components` folder:

```css
.welcome-box {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Now update your component to use this style:

```jsx
import './Welcome.css';

function Welcome() {
  return (
    <div className="welcome-box">
      <h2>Welcome to React!</h2>
      <p>This is your first styled component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Welcome;
```

This shows how you can apply external styles by importing the CSS file into your component.

#### Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve just created your first functional component in React. This component-based approach allows for clean, reusable, and manageable code. As your app grows, you'll build many components and nest them together to form the full user interface. Components are truly the building blocks of React.
