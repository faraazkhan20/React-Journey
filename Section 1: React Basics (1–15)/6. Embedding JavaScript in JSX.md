### Topic 6: Embedding JavaScript in JSX

One of the most powerful and flexible features of JSX in React is the ability to **embed JavaScript expressions directly within JSX code**. This ability enables dynamic rendering of content, such as displaying a user's name, evaluating a condition, or looping over data to create lists. JSX lets you use JavaScript wherever needed, without switching context, making your UI highly dynamic and customizable.

#### Using Curly Braces to Embed JavaScript

In JSX, you use **curly braces `{}`** to embed JavaScript expressions. These can include variables, function calls, string concatenations, arithmetic operations, and more. Anything you put inside the curly braces must evaluate to a single value (string, number, JSX, etc.).

Here’s a simple example:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  const name = "John";
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

In this component, the variable `name` is inserted directly into the JSX using `{name}`. When rendered, this will display "Hello, John!".

---

#### Expressions vs. Statements

Only expressions—not statements—can be used inside curly braces. An **expression** returns a value (e.g., `a + b`, `user.name`, `new Date()`), whereas a **statement** performs an action (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`). For instance, you can’t write an `if` statement directly in JSX, but you can use a **ternary operator**, which *is* an expression.

Invalid (this will throw an error):

```jsx
{/* if (loggedIn) { return <p>Welcome</p>; } */} 
```

Valid:

```jsx
{loggedIn ? <p>Welcome</p> : <p>Please log in</p>}
```

This is a powerful way to handle conditional rendering within JSX.

---

#### Embedding Functions and Calculations

You can also embed function calls or perform calculations inline. For example:

```jsx
function UserInfo() {
  const user = { firstName: "Alice", lastName: "Doe" };

  function getFullName(user) {
    return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
  }

  return <h2>User: {getFullName(user)}</h2>;
}
```

Here, the function `getFullName` is called directly within the JSX, dynamically returning the user’s full name.

---

#### Inline Conditional Rendering with Logical &&

Another common pattern is using the logical AND (`&&`) operator to conditionally render a block of JSX only if a condition is true:

```jsx
function Cart({ items }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
      {items.length > 0 && <p>You have {items.length} items in your cart.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the message is only shown if the `items` array has one or more elements.

---

#### Mapping Over Arrays in JSX

React encourages rendering lists using the `.map()` function. This allows you to dynamically render multiple elements from an array:

```jsx
function UserList() {
  const users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{user}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Each item in the array is rendered as an `<li>` tag. The `key` prop is essential here—it helps React efficiently update the DOM.

---

#### Formatting and Using Dates

You can also use built-in JavaScript objects like `Date`:

```jsx
function Clock() {
  const now = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
  return <p>Current Time: {now}</p>;
}
```

The date is evaluated and displayed each time the component renders.

---

#### Combining Strings and Expressions

You can build strings dynamically by combining literals and expressions:

```jsx
function WelcomeMessage({ name }) {
  return <p>{`Welcome back, ${name}!`}</p>;
}
```

You can also use expressions directly:

```jsx
return <p>Welcome back, {name.toUpperCase()}!</p>;
```

---

#### JSX Inside JavaScript

You can assign JSX to variables and return it conditionally:

```jsx
function Status({ isOnline }) {
  const statusMessage = isOnline ? <span>Online</span> : <span>Offline</span>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Status:</h2>
      {statusMessage}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here, JSX elements are stored in a variable and then rendered inside another JSX block.

---

#### Conclusion

Embedding JavaScript in JSX is the essence of writing dynamic and responsive UI in React. Whether you're injecting a value, toggling a UI element, looping over data, or formatting output, curly braces make it easy to blend logic with markup. Mastering this ability is key to writing effective React components. It transforms static UIs into powerful, data-driven applications by leveraging the full power of JavaScript within the comfort of JSX syntax.
