### Topic 3: Project Folder Structure in React with Vite

Understanding the structure of a React project is essential before diving into development. When using Vite to scaffold (meaning quickly generating project structure and files) a React app, it generates a clean, minimal, and well-organized folder structure. This makes it easy for beginners to understand and maintain code as the project grows. Let’s explore the purpose of each file and folder so you can navigate your React project confidently.

#### Root-Level Files and Folders

After running `npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react`, your project will include the following at the root level:

```
my-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
├── src/
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
└── README.md
```

Let’s break these down one by one.

* **`node_modules/`**: This folder is auto-generated when you run `npm install`. It stores all the third-party libraries your project depends on. You should never edit this manually.

* **`public/`**: Contains static assets that won’t go through the build process. If you place an image or a favicon here, you can access it directly by path (e.g., `/vite.svg`). Avoid putting sensitive or dynamic content here.

* **`src/`**: This is where all your application code lives. You’ll spend most of your time inside this folder. It usually includes:

  * `main.jsx`: The entry point where React is initialized and the App component is rendered.
  * `App.jsx`: The root component where your main UI logic begins.
  * `App.css` and `index.css`: Stylesheets for your app.

* **`.gitignore`**: Tells Git which files/folders to ignore in version control (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env` files).

* **`index.html`**: Unlike traditional websites, this HTML file has only a `<div id="root"></div>`, where the React app will mount. Vite injects your app bundle here automatically.

* **`package.json`**: Lists all your project dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It’s the core of your project’s configuration.

* **`vite.config.js`**: Contains Vite-specific configuration. For example, customizing server ports, aliases, or plugins.

* **`README.md`**: Basic markdown file where you can write instructions or project details.

#### Modifying the Structure

As your project grows, you’ll likely refactor `src/` into subfolders like:

```
src/
├── assets/       # Images, fonts
├── components/   # Reusable UI parts
├── pages/        # Route-based page components
├── hooks/        # Custom hooks
├── utils/        # Helper functions
├── context/      # React Context files
├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
```

This modular structure helps keep logic separated and organized.

#### Example: main.jsx and App.jsx

Here’s a practical look at what your `main.jsx` might contain:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

And your `App.jsx`:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from App Component!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Conclusion

A well-structured project makes development easier and scalable. Vite’s default structure is minimal but powerful, and it gives you the flexibility to expand logically as your app grows. By organizing files thoughtfully, you ensure clean, maintainable code throughout your React journey.
