### Topic 5: JSX Syntax & Rules

When working with React, one of the first things you’ll notice is the use of **JSX**, or JavaScript XML. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript files. While it may look like HTML at first glance, JSX is actually syntactic sugar for `React.createElement()` calls. JSX makes writing React components more intuitive and easier to visualize.

#### Why JSX?

React components describe what the UI should look like. JSX provides a readable and expressive way to define that structure. Without JSX, you'd have to write nested `React.createElement()` calls, which quickly becomes messy. JSX simplifies this process and feels familiar if you’ve worked with HTML before.

Here’s a quick example without JSX:

```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
```

And with JSX, the same code becomes:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This cleaner syntax makes JSX preferred for most React development.

---

#### Basic JSX Syntax

At the core of JSX is a mix of HTML-like tags and JavaScript expressions. You can return JSX inside any functional component:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Good morning!</h1>;
}
```

Remember, each component must return a **single parent element**. If you need to return multiple sibling elements, wrap them in a `<div>` or use a special React fragment (`<>...</>`):

```jsx
function Info() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>User Info</h2>
      <p>Name: Alice</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

#### Embedding JavaScript Expressions

One powerful feature of JSX is the ability to embed any JavaScript expression inside curly braces `{}`. This lets you insert variables, run functions, or perform calculations inline with your HTML:

```jsx
function WelcomeUser(props) {
  return <p>Welcome, {props.name}!</p>;
}
```

Here, `props.name` is a JavaScript expression evaluated and inserted into the output.

You can also do math:

```jsx
const age = 25;
return <p>You are {age * 2} years old in dog years.</p>;
```

---

#### JSX Attributes

JSX uses **camelCase** for most HTML attributes. For example, `class` becomes `className` and `for` becomes `htmlFor`. This is because `class` and `for` are reserved keywords in JavaScript:

```jsx
function StyledBox() {
  return <div className="container">Styled content</div>;
}
```

Boolean attributes like `checked`, `disabled`, or `readOnly` are passed as `true` if specified without a value:

```jsx
<input type="checkbox" checked />
```

---

#### Self-Closing Tags

Just like in HTML, some tags don’t need closing pairs, like `<img>` or `<input>`. In JSX, these must be **self-closed with a slash** at the end:

```jsx
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

If you forget the `/`, you’ll get a syntax error.

---

#### JavaScript Logic (Conditionals & Loops)

JSX doesn’t allow `if` statements or `for` loops directly inside the return block. But you can use **ternary expressions** or `map()` for conditional rendering and looping:

```jsx
const isLoggedIn = true;
return <p>{isLoggedIn ? 'Welcome back!' : 'Please log in.'}</p>;
```

For looping:

```jsx
const users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
return (
  <ul>
    {users.map(user => (
      <li key={user}>{user}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

---

#### Wrapping JSX in Parentheses

It’s best practice to wrap multiline JSX in parentheses, especially in return statements. This avoids automatic semicolon insertion issues:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </div>
);
```

---

#### JSX is Not HTML

Though JSX looks like HTML, it's not. JSX gets compiled into `React.createElement` calls. This means:

* You can’t use custom attributes not recognized by React.
* You must close all tags.
* Comments use `{/* comment */}` syntax inside JSX.

Example of a comment in JSX:

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    {/* This is a comment */}
    <h1>JSX Demo</h1>
  </div>
);
```

#### Conclusion

JSX is the foundation of React development. It allows developers to combine HTML-like syntax with JavaScript logic in a clear and maintainable way. While it may take a little getting used to, once you understand its syntax and rules—such as self-closing tags, camelCase attributes, and wrapping everything in a single parent—it becomes second nature. JSX makes your code easier to write, read, and debug, giving you full power to describe UIs in a declarative way.
